1) Originally tested the 4 different clustering algorithms available in Seurat clustering FindClusters function.  
   (https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/findclusters) 
   on example data (https://github.com/cellgeni/notebooks/tree/master/data/soupX_pbmc10k_filt) to compare clusterings
   (https://github.com/SimonDMurray/clustering_investigation/blob/main/clustering.R)

2) Stats for the PCA of this public dataset ((https://github.com/cellgeni/notebooks/tree/master/data/soupX_pbmc10k_filt)
   were calculated such as dispersion and euclidean values
   (https://github.com/SimonDMurray/clustering_investigation/blob/main/pca_statistics.R)

3) Biological information for a pbmc dataset (https://github.com/cellgeni/notebooks/blob/master/data/pbmc10k_filt.h5) was calculated
   (https://github.com/SimonDMurray/clustering_investigation/blob/main/biology-info.R)

4) A dataset from a Hao et Hao integration paper (https://zenodo.org/record/4546839#.YkrJky-cbmF) was used to explore clustering. 
   In this dataset, it was noticed that the count matrix had been removed to save space.

5) Heatmaps were generated from a matrix tsv file generated by a script which used input file generated by clm dist.
   (https://github.com/SimonDMurray/clustering_investigation/blob/main/produce_matrix.py)
   These heatmaps compared seurat and mcl clusterings
   (https://github.com/SimonDMurray/clustering_investigation/blob/main/generate_heatmap.R)
   
6) The outputs of the Seurat FindNeighbours function 
   (https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/findneighbors) 
   with retunr.nieghbours parameter set to true were combined

7) The Hao et Hao dataset (https://zenodo.org/record/4546839#.YkrJky-cbmF) was visualised to see if any nodes often changed cluster using
  mcxdump input file in this script (https://github.com/SimonDMurray/clustering_investigation/blob/main/visualise_clustering.R)

8) We then asked how to recreate the original data (https://github.com/satijalab/azimuth/issues/98) which instructed us to a snake file
   (https://github.com/satijalab/azimuth-references/tree/master/human_pbmc)
   which we used to recreate the data
  
9) Additionally, we also found what we beleived to be the original data (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE164378) 
   which was also confirmed in the github issue answer given earlier
  
10) The data generated from the snakefile was used to analyse lots of rcl information as well as mcl and leiden clustering shown in a notebook 
   (https://github.com/SimonDMurray/clustering_investigation/blob/main/rcl_visualisation.R)
